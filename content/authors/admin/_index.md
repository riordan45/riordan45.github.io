Greetings! I am a Machine Learning Engineer, originally from Romania, and a co-founder at [TeesyTek](https://teesytek.com/), where we develop [robots for golf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMOTUWxCDPc). Previously, I was a Research Associate in the [Statistical Machine Learning Group](https://www.sml-group.cc/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) where I helped develop [vGPMP](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/c-cosier24a.html), a highly customizable probabilistic motion planning algorithm. During my MSc, I published at an ICML workshop about the optimization dynamics of Reinforcement Learning algorithms [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04210). I also feel fortunate to have interned at [CERN](https://home.cern/) where I applied different Graph Neural Network techniques to Particle Physics. You can find more about it [here](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2864131).

I am passionate about technology and enjoy engaging in meaningful discussions on various topics. I'm open to new ventures, so always feel free to reach out! More than anything, I thrive on tackling challenging problems where the solutions aren't immediately obvious, as it drives me to innovate and learn continuously.
