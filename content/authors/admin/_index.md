Hi there! I am **Daniel**, a software engineer based in Switzerland. Originally from Romania, I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at the [Polytechnic University](https://www.upt.ro/) in [Timișoara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timi%C8%99oara). Presently, I am living in the picturesque alpine nation pursuing my interest in life sciences by studying [Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://cbb.ethz.ch) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html).

I am passionate about technology and I'm always down to engage in constructive discussions about various topics. I enjoy spending time with motivated people who share my curiosity and drive to learn more about the world.

 During my downtime, you can find me hiking, playing tennis or reading a book.
