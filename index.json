During my MSc, I published at an ICML workshop about the optimization dynamics of Reinforcement Learning algorithms here. I also feel fortunate to have interned at CERN where I applied different Graph Neural Network techniques to Particle Physics. You can find more about it here.\nI am passionate about technology and enjoy engaging in meaningful discussions on various topics. I’m open to new ventures, so always feel free to reach out! More than anything, I thrive on tackling challenging problems where the solutions aren’t immediately obvious, as it drives me to innovate and learn continuously.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Greetings!
